The area-based aggregation methods are based in grouping rectangular areas of cells of the finer resolution image to create a new map with larger cells. To do that, the function *aggregate()* of the package *raster* needs to know the factor of aggregation. In this case, the factor is 3 as it needs to go from 333m to 1km. In addition, *aggregate()* can perform the calculation using different functions. While the default is the average (*mean()*) it can work also with *modal()*, *max()* or *min()*.\n",
